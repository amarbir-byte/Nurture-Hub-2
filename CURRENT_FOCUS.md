- **Project Management Setup** - Ensuring no context loss between sessions

### **‚è≥ REMAINING THIS SESSION**
1. **Update NEXT_SESSION.md** - Handoff document for next Claude session
2. **Update project.md** - Sync with enterprise features added
3. **Document session accomplishments** - Complete project tracking updates

### **üéØ CRITICAL NEXT PRIORITIES** (For Next Session)
1. **Fix ContactForm.tsx TypeScript errors** - Largest remaining blocker
2. **Complete TypeScript build resolution** - Enable production deployment
3. **Test full production deployment** - End-to-end validation
4. **Launch user acceptance testing** - Beta program ready

## üìã **CURRENT SPRINT BACKLOG**

### **üî¥ Critical (Must Do)**
- [ ] **Resolve Vercel deployment limits** - Requires user decision on Pro upgrade
- [ ] **Fix all linting errors** - 140+ errors blocking CI/CD
- [ ] **Complete documentation system** - Professional handoff process

### **üü† High Priority (Should Do)**
- [ ] **Test production deployment** - Once blockers resolved
- [ ] **Verify environment variables** - Ensure monitoring functions work
- [ ] **Update all project documentation** - Sync with reality

### **üü° Medium Priority (Nice to Have)**
- [ ] **Connect external monitoring** - DataDog/New Relic integration
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Based on real production data
- [ ] **Beta testing preparation** - User acceptance testing setup

## üß≠ **DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY**

### **Current Approach:**
1. **Professional Foundation First** - Establish proper project management
2. **Quality Gates** - Fix all code quality issues
3. **Deployment Resolution** - Get production pipeline working
4. **Feature Polish** - Enhance based on real usage

### **Decision Points:**
- **Vercel vs Alternatives** - Need user decision on deployment platform
- **Monitoring Services** - Which external services to integrate
- **Beta Testing Timeline** - When to launch user acceptance testing

### **Success Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ Zero context loss between Claude sessions
- ‚úÖ All code passes linting and CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Production deployment working smoothly
- ‚úÖ Professional development workflow established

---

## üìù **SESSION NOTES**

### **Key Insights This Session:**
- Project was more advanced than documented (enterprise features added)
- Major gap between project.md and actual implementation
- Need systematic approach to prevent context loss
- Code quality issues blocking professional deployment

### **Decisions Made:**
- Implement comprehensive documentation system
- Focus on professional project management practices
- Address deployment blockers as top priority
- Establish quality gates for all future work

### **Lessons Learned:**
- Always update documentation immediately when adding features
- Need systematic handoff process between development sessions
- Code quality must be maintained throughout development
- Professional project management prevents "losing the plot"

## üîÑ **WORKFLOW STATUS**

### **Development Environment:**
- ‚úÖ Local development running at `localhost:5176`
- ‚úÖ All core features functional in development
- ‚ùå Production deployment blocked (Vercel limits)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  CI/CD pipeline failing (linting errors)

### **Code Quality:**
- ‚úÖ Core application logic solid
- ‚úÖ Enterprise features implemented
- ‚ùå Linting errors need cleanup (140+ errors)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  TypeScript strict mode compliance needed

### **Documentation Status:**

- ‚úÖ BLOCKERS.md - All issues documented
- ‚úÖ CURRENT_FOCUS.md - This session tracking
- ‚è≥ NEXT_SESSION.md - Pending creation
- ‚è≥ Updated project.md - Pending sync

---

## ‚ö° **NEXT ACTIONS** (Before Session Ends)

1. **Complete NEXT_SESSION.md** - Detailed handoff for next Claude
2. **Update project.md** - Add Phase 6 enterprise work
3. **Create DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md** - Infrastructure tracking
4. **Start linting cleanup** - Begin fixing critical errors
5. **Commit all documentation** - Ensure nothing is lost

**‚è∞ Time Check:** Monitor remaining session time and prioritize accordingly
