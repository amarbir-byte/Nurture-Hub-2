**Handoff Date:** September 28, 2025
**Session Type:** Continue Professional Project Management Implementation
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for complete resolution
**Current Phase:** Phase 6 Enterprise Infrastructure (75% complete)

---

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE START PROTOCOL**

### **üìñ STEP 1: READ THESE FILES FIRST (5 minutes)**
1. **`PROJECT_STATUS.md`** - Current state of entire project (85% complete overall)
2. **`BLOCKERS.md`** - Critical issues preventing progress (3 critical blockers)
3. **`CURRENT_FOCUS.md`** - What was being worked on last session

### **üîç STEP 2: QUICK STATUS CHECK (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Check if Vercel deployment limits have reset
npx vercel --prod

# If still blocked, you'll see: "Resource is limited - try again in 2 hours"
# If working, deployment will proceed
```

### **‚ö° STEP 3: CHOOSE YOUR PATH**

#### **PATH A: If Vercel Deployment Works**
1. ‚úÖ **Complete documentation system** (finish remaining files)
2. ‚úÖ **Fix all linting errors** (critical for CI/CD)
3. ‚úÖ **Test production deployment** (end-to-end validation)
4. ‚úÖ **Launch user acceptance testing** (business milestone)

#### **PATH B: If Vercel Still Blocked**
1. ‚úÖ **Complete documentation system** (finish remaining files)
2. ‚úÖ **Fix all linting errors** (prepare for when deployment works)
3. ‚úÖ **Document alternative deployment options** (Netlify, Railway, etc.)
4. ‚úÖ **Present deployment strategy to user** (Pro upgrade vs alternatives)

## üî• **CRITICAL PRIORITIES** (Must Do This Session)

### **PRIORITY 1: Complete Documentation System**
```bash
# Files still needed:
- DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md (infrastructure tracking)
- Update project.md (add Phase 6 enterprise features)
- Update CLAUDE.md (professional instructions)
```

### **PRIORITY 2: Fix Code Quality Issues**
- **Target**: Reduce 140+ linting errors to zero
- **Focus**: API monitoring files first (most critical)
