## üéØ **Current Focus Areas**

### **1. Deployment Resolution** (Critical Priority)
- **Issue**: Vercel free tier limit exceeded (100 deployments/day)
- **Impact**: Cannot deploy fixes or test in production
- **Solutions**: Upgrade to Pro ($20/month) or alternative platform

### **2. Code Quality & CI/CD** (High Priority)
- **Issue**: 140+ linting errors blocking automated deployments
- **Files Affected**: API monitoring files (any types, unused variables)
- **Impact**: CI/CD pipeline fails, no automated quality gates

### **3. Professional Project Management** (High Priority)
- **Issue**: Poor handoff between Claude sessions
- **Impact**: Context loss, repeated work, inefficient development
- **Solution**: Implementing comprehensive documentation system

## üöß **Active Development**

### **Current Sprint Goals:**
1. **Resolve deployment blockers** - Fix Vercel limits and linting errors
2. **Implement project tracking system** - Professional documentation structure
3. **Clean up code quality** - Pass all CI/CD gates
4. **Test production deployment** - Ensure all enterprise features work

### **Next Major Features:**
1. **User Acceptance Testing** - Beta program with real estate agents
2. **Advanced Analytics** - Campaign performance insights
3. **API Integrations** - Real geocoding, SMS providers
4. **White-label Options** - Enterprise customization

## üìà **Key Metrics & Health**

### **Technical Health:**
- **Code Quality**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Work (140+ linting errors)
- **Test Coverage**: üîÑ Partial (manual testing)

## üîÑ **Development Methodology**

This project follows an **agile enterprise development** approach:
- **Continuous Integration**: All code changes trigger automated testing
- **Quality Gates**: Linting, type checking, security scans before deployment
- **Professional Handoffs**: Comprehensive documentation for context preservation
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Core MVP + enterprise features in phases
